# _Contactbook_
As a python beginner, I made this project named Contact Book using Oject-Oriented Python Programming and the GUI is created with the use of 
Tkinter library. Further with the use of SQLite 3 Database, this Contact Book can perform certain operations like keeping records of your
contact list, allowing you to insert and delete a contact from your Contact Book if you want to do so.
